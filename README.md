# Credit Card Customer Segmentation: Clustering
Link to my Kaggle notebook of the project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nambui433/credit-card-customer-segmentation-clustering

## Introduction
In this project, I perform unsupervised clustering on credit card customers using their records from the credit card provider's database. Credit card customers are categorized into groups that share similar significant features, thereby helping the credit card provider develop specialized customer strategies and targeted measures for each group of customers. 

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains credit card customer's information collected from within a consumer credit card portfolio. It includes comprehensive demographic details such as age, gender, marital status and income category, as well as insight into each customer’s relationship with the credit card provider such as the card type, number of months on book and inactive periods. Most importantly, the dataset holds key records of customers’ spending behavior such as total revolving balance, credit limit, average open to buy rate, and average utilization ratio. Originally, there are 23 features available for 10,000 datapoints. 

## Modelling
K-means Clustering algorithm is used for this project. 

K-means Clustering is a partitioning technique that groups data points into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

## Requirments
The code for this project was written in Python 3.8 and requires the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- yellowbrick
- mpl_toolkits

## Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file.
